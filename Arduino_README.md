As a practical engineer of electronics I uses Arduino Mega 2560 board to connect componnets by wires
In addition, You can use Arduino as a coding language, you can write commands to the board with digitalwrite command.
Arduino can read commands from the computer by the user , the user need to write digitalread command.
