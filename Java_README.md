# JAVA 
Java - As a qa automation I used this language to check login textbox (password and username) of saucedemo website. I used selenium IDE webdrive to get in "https://www.saucedemo.com/" .
Selenium is an IDE that allow the tester: click buttons, type text, navigate pages.
I used Inspect button (computer) to see the styles and elements of the website and after that I checked by myself if the test case is happend
The qa need to think about all scenarios and check one by one to see what happend(valid or invalid)
I checked 8 tests cases that the user can not entered and at test case number nine the user entered the website and can buy products the result of the test case is shown on the terminal after the user login successful (tc9)
