# PROJECTS
I used IDE to create two codes: ARDUINO+JAVA 

Arduino is a memory program - the code you write on his environment is saved by clicking verify buttom

As a practical engineer of electronics I uses Arduino Mega 2560 board to connect componnets by wires  
 
In addition, You can use Arduino as a coding language, you can write commands to the board with digitalwrite command.

Arduino can read commands from the computer by the user , the user need to write digitalread command.

Java - As a qa i used this language to check login textbox (password and username) of saucedemo website.
I used selenium IDE webdrive to get in  "https://www.saucedemo.com/" .
with selenium you can clicking buttons, typing text, navigating pages.

The qa need to think about all scenarios and check one by one to see what happend(valid or invalid)  

I checked 8 tests cases that the user can not entered and at test case number nine the user entered the website and can buy products
