# PROJECTS
I used IDE to create two codes: ARDUINO+JAVA 

Arduino is a memory program - the code you write on his environment is saved by clicking verify buttom

As a practical engineer of electronics I uses Arduino Mega 2560 board to connect componnets by wires  
 
In addition, You can use Arduino as a coding language, you can write commands to the board with digitalwrite command.

Arduino can read commands from the computer by the user , the user need to write digitalread command.

Java - As a qa automation i used this language to check login textbox (password and username) of saucedemo website.
I used selenium IDE webdrive to get in  "https://www.saucedemo.com/" .

 Selenium is an IDE that allow the tester: click buttons, type text, navigate pages.

 I used Inspect button (computer) to see the styles and elements of the website and after that I checked by myself if the test case is happend  

The qa need to think about all scenarios and check one by one to see what happend(valid or invalid)  

I checked 8 tests cases that the user can not entered and at test case number nine the user entered the website and can buy products
